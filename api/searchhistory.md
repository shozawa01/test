# Search History

REST API located at /api/searchhistory

The search history API is used to pull back a list of searches that a user, group, or combination thereof have launched.  The results provide basic info like who launched the search, what group owns it, when it was launched and the two strings representing the search (what the user actually typed, and what the backend processed).

## Basic API overview

The basic action here is to perform a GET on /api/searchhistory/{cmd}/{id} with cmd representing what set of searches you want and id representing the ID related to that search.  For example if you wanted all searches owned by the user with the UID 1 you would perform a GET on /api/searchhistory/user/1 where if you wanted all searches owned by group with GID 4 you would perform a GET on /api/searchhistory/group/4.

You can request ALL searches a specific UID has access to using the "all" cmd.  This means give me all searches owned by the UID as well as all searches that are owned by groups he is a member of.  For example a GET on /api/searchhistory/all/1  may return searches owned by group with GIDs 1, 2, 3, and 4 if the user with UID 1 is a member of those groups.   The returned results will be a list of SearchLog structures in JSON format

Example JSON:
```

                "GID": 2,
                "UserQuery": "grep stuff",
                "EffectiveQuery": "grep stuff | text",

        },
        {

                "GID": 2,
                "UserQuery": "grep stuff | grep things | grep that | grep this | sort by time",
                "EffectiveQuery": "grep stuff | grep things | grep that | grep this | sort by time | text",
