## Langfind

The langfind module is a basic human language analysis module that searches data for text and attempts to classify that text as a human language.

### Example Search

The following search will build a table of the most common languages used in Reddit comments, in descending order from most popular to least.

```
tag=reddit json Body | langfind -e Body | count by lang | sort by count desc | table lang count
```

### Supported Options

* `-e <arg>`: The “-e” option operates on an enumerated value instead of on the entire record. For example, a pipeline that performed language analysis on HTTP payloads would be `tag=pcap ipv4.DstPort==80 tcp.Payload | langfind -e Payload`
