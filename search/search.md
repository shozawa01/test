# Searching with Gravwell

The search pipeline is the core of Gravwell's functionality. You specify a data source on the left side ("upstream"), then specify a number of filters through which the data must pass before finally reaching a renderer "downstream" for display. For example, the following query fetches data tagged "reddit", uses the json module to extract a field called Body, then uses the eval module to filter out any entries with Body fields longer than 20 characters, then finally uses the table renderer to display the contents of the Body fields:

```
tag=reddit json Body | eval len(Body) < 20 | table Body
```

## Enumerated Values

Enumerated values are special data elements which are created and used within the search pipeline. In the pipeline below, several enumerated values are created.

```
tag=reddit json Body | langfind -e Body | count by lang | sort by count desc | table lang count
```

First, the json module parses the JSON in the raw entries and pulls out the "Body" element, storing it in an enumerated value named `Body`. Then the langfind module accesses the `Body` enumerated values and attempts to analyze the language used; it puts the result in a new enumerated value called `lang`. Next, the count module reads the `lang` enumerated values and counts how many times each value appears, storing the results in enumerated values named `count`. The rest of the pipeline sorts the results based on the counts and creates a table from the `lang` and `count` enumerated values.

Further examples throughout the documentation should help clarify the use of enumerated values.

## Quoting and tokenizing

When specifying arguments to Gravwell modules, be mindful of special characters. Most modules treat spaces, tabs, newlines, and the following characters as separators: !#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@

When specifying an argument to a module which contains one of these characters, wrap the argument in double-quotes:

```
json "search-id"
```

```
grep "dank memes"
```

You can escape double quote characters if you need to use them, for instance to identify mis-used dialog tags in text you could search for the sequence `",`:

```
grep "\","
```

## Search Modules

Search modules are used to analyze data entries, filtering out undesired data or extracting interesting portions of the data. A search pipeline may include many search modules, one after another, each operating on the results of the previous module.

## Render Modules

Render modules take the results generated by the search modules and present them to the user graphically. A search pipeline will only include one render module, at the very end of the pipeline.
