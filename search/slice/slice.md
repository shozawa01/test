## Slice

The slice module is a powerful but very low-level tool for extracting bytes from entries or enumerated values by simply specifying offsets within the entry/enumerated value and optionally casting those bytes to specific type.  Slice can reference bytes via relative indexing, including negative numbers.

The following search extracts the RPM from canbus messages on a Toyota vehicle by reading the first two bytes of the "data" enumerated value and parsing it as a 16-bit big-endian integer.

```
tag=CAN canbus ID=0x2C4 | slice uint16be(data[0:2]) as RPM | mean RPM | chart mean
```

Slice can extract from raw entry contents, or it can operate on an enumerated value. The extracted bytes can optionally be parsed into a different type, such as an integer or a string. Some examples:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `slice [0:4] as foo` | Extract the first 5 bytes directly from the entry's data and place them into an enumerated value "foo" |
| `slice Payload[9] as tenth` | Extract the tenth byte from the enumerated value "Payload" |
| `slice uint16le(Payload[9:10]) as value` | Pull two bytes from the enumerated value "Payload", parse them as an unsigned 16-bit little-endian integer, and store it as "value" |
| `slice uint16be(Payload[-2:]) as value` | Pull the last two bytes from "Payload", parse them as an unsigned 16-bit big-endian integer, and store it as "value" |
| `slice uint16be(Payload[-4:-2]) as value2` | Pull the two bytes preceding the last two bytes of "Payload", parse them as an unsigned 16-bit big-endian integer, and store as "value2"

### Supported Types

An integral function of the slice module is casting the data to the appropriate type.  By default, data is extracted as a byte slice, but the option cast allows us to transform it into a type.  Types that have a suffix of "be" indicate a [Big Endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) bit order, those without a "be" suffix use a Little Endian bit order.

### Inline filtering

The slice module supports inline filtering which allows for very fast processing of binary data.  Every type does not support every filter operation.  For example attempting to find a subset in a floating point number does not make any sense, nor does applying "less than" to a byte slice.  Below is the complete list of filter operators and a table showing which operators can be applied to which types:

#### Filter Operators

| Operator | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| == | Equal | Field must be equal
| != | Not equal | Field must not be equal
| ~ | Subset | Field contains the value
| !~ | Not Subset | Field does NOT contain the value
| < | Less Than | Numeric value of field is less than
| <= | Less Than or Equal to | Numeric value of field is less than or equal to
| > | Greater Than | Numeric value of field is greater than
| >= | Greater Than or Equal to | Numeric value of field is greater than or equal to

#### Supported Operators by Type
