## J1939

J1939 is an extension of the canbus protocol with well defined ID codes and offset values.  J1939 is typically used in heavy trucking.

| mod | Field | Operators | Example 
|-----|-------|-----------|---------
| j1939 | Priority | == != < > <= >= | j1939 Priority==1
| j1939 | DP | == != < > <= >=| j1939 DP != 1 
| j1939 | EDP | == != < > <= >= | j1939 EDP == 0 
| j1939 | PDU | == != < > <= >= | j1939 PDU != 0x234 
| j1939 | PF | == != < > <= >= | j1939 PF != 220 
| j1939 | PS | == != | j1939 PS == true 
| j1939 | SRC | == != < > <= >= | j1939 SRC != 0x123 
| j1939 | Data | ~ !~ | j1939 Data ~ TEST

### Example Search

The following search will extract the engine temperature from J1939 bus traffic and display the slope of the curve in a chart over time.  This query would be extremely useful in fleet management in identifying trucks that heat up more quickly than others, potentially indicating a maintenance problem.

```
tag=trucks j1939 EDP==0 PF==254 Data | slice uint16be(Data[2:3]) as engine_oil_temp | variance engine_oil_temp by SRC over 30s | chart variance by SRC
```
