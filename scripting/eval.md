# The eval module

As introduced in [the search modules documentation](#!search/searchmodules.md#Eval), Gravwell's eval module is a general tool for manipulating search entries when other modules may fall short. It uses the [Anko scripting language](scripting.md) to provide generic scriptability within the pipeline.

The eval module has several important restrictions:

* Only a single statement may be defined: `(x==y || j < 2)` is acceptable, as is `if SrcPort==80 { setEnum("http", true) }`, but `setEnum(foo, "1"); setEnum(bar, "2")` is two statements and will not work. See the following section for more details
* Functions cannot be defined or imported
* Loops are not allowed
* No access to the resource system

Note: To make the structure of your eval expression more clear, hit Ctrl-Enter while typing the query to insert newlines if needed.

See the generic description of the scripting languaged used in [the Anko scripting language documentation](scripting.md) for more details about the language itself.

## Filtering: Expressions vs. Statements

The eval module will filter entries when the argument is an expression; it will not filter when the argument is a statement. Consider the following example:

```
tag=reddit json Body | eval len(Body) < 20 | table Body
```

`len(Body) < 20` is an expression, so only entries which match the expression are allowed to continue down the pipeline. In contrast, consider the following:

```
tag=reddit json Body | eval if len(Body) <= 10 { setEnum("postlen", "short"); setEnum(“anotherEnum”, “foo”) } | table Body
```

The `if` form is a statement; all entries continue down the pipeline regardless of the outcome of the if statement.

An expression is something which evaluates to a value, like the string `“foo”` or the number `1.5`. This also includes function calls, like `DoStuff(15)`, and boolean expressions such as `myVariable == 42`. Basically, anything which you could assign to a variable or pass as an argument to a function can be considered an expression.

A statement controls the flow and structure of the script, like `if` and `switch` statements, variable creation/assignment, a return, etc. A statement might itself contain multiple sub-statements; for example, an `if` statement contains an expression and several lists of statements. If the expression evaluates to true, one list of statements is executed. If the expression evalutes to false, a different list is executed.

## Enumerated Values

Within an eval statement, existing enumerated values may be referred to as if they were regular variables:

```
tag=reddit json Body | eval len(Body) < 20 | table Body
```

However, to set an enumerated value, a more explicit statement is required. The `setEnum` function takes a name and a value as arguments. It creates or updates an enumerated value with the given name, inferring the correct enumerated value type for the given value:

```
tag=reddit json Body | eval if len(Body) <= 10 { setEnum("postlen", "short") } else if len(Body) > 10 && len(Body) < 300 { setEnum("postlen", "medium") } else { setEnum("postlen", "long") } | count by postlen | table postlen count
```

The `delEnum` function will delete the specified enumerated value if desired, although this is rarely needed.

## Utility Functions

Eval provides built-in utility functions, listed below in the format `functionName(<functionArgs>) <returnValues>`:

* `setEnum(key, value)` creates an enumerated value named key containing value, which can be any valid enumerated value type.
* `delEnum(key)` deletes an enumerated value named key.
* `hasEnum(key) bool` returns a boolean indicating whether the entry has the enumerated value.
* `setPersistentMap(mapname, key, value)` stores a key-value pair in a map which will persist for the entire search.
* `getPersistentMap(mapname, key) value` returns the value associated with the given key from the named persistent map.
* `len(val) int` returns the length of val, which can be a string, slice, etc.
* `toIP(string) IP` converts string to an IP, suitable for comparing against IPs generated by e.g. the packet module.
* `toMAC(string) MAC` converts string to a MAC address.
* `toString(val) string` converts val to a string.
* `toInt(val) int64` converts val to an integer if possible. Returns 0 if no conversion is possible.
* `toFloat(val) float64` converts val to a floating point number if possible. Returns 0.0 if no conversion is possible.
* `toBool(val) bool` attempts to convert val to a boolean. Returns false if no conversion is possible. Non-zero numbers and the strings “y”, “yes”, and “true” will return true.
* `typeOf(val) type` returns the type of val as a string, e.g. “string”, “bool”.

The conversion functions are particularly important because eval can't always do implicit conversion the way you want. For example, the packet module extracts IPs in a special type, not just a string. In order to properly compare against an enumerated value containing an IP, you must use the `IP` function:

```
tag=pcap packet ipv4.SrcIP | eval SrcIP != toIP("192.168.0.1") | count by SrcIP | table SrcIP count
```

You can check the type of an enumerated value by using the `typeOf` function, in case you're getting unexpected results:

```
tag=pcap packet ipv4.SrcIP | eval setEnum("type", typeOf(SrcIP)) | table type
```

In this case, the results show that `SrcIP` is a net.IP.

#### Persistent Maps

Eval provides a method to store data in a map, meaning data from one entry can be stored for later comparison against another entry. The `SetPersistentMap(mapname, key, value)` function creates or updates an entry in a map (specified by `mapname` parameter) mapping the given string `key` to the `value`, which can be anything. The `GetPersistentMap(mapname, key)` function can then be used to retrieve that information.

To give an example of the persistent map functionality, consider the following json-formatted Hacker News comment (not a real comment):

```
{"body": "The eval function has persistent map capabilities", "author": "Gravwell", "article-id": 1234000, "parent-id": 1234111, "article-title": "Gravwell for data analysis", "date-string": "0 minutes ago", "type": "comment", "id": 1234222}
```

Note that the comment contains an ID for the current comment (1234222), the author's name ("Gravwell"), and the ID for the parent comment (12341111), but not the name of the parent comment's author.

The following command attempts to match parent IDs to author names. For every comment it sees, it stores a mapping of the comment ID to the author name in a map named "id_to_name". Then, it checks if the parent ID has an entry in that map; if so, it sets the `parentauthor` enumerated value to that name, otherwise it sets the enumerated value to "unknown".

```
tag=hackernews json author id "parent-id" as parentid | sort asc | eval if true { setPersistentMap("id_to_name", id, author);  name = getPersistentMap("id_to_name", parentid); if name != nil { setEnum("parentauthor", name) } else { setEnum("parentauthor", "unknown") } } | table author id parentid parentauthor
```

One limitation of this approach is that the oldest comments, processed first, will be replying to even older comments which will not appear in the search; thus, the first results will all have a parent author of "unknown", with more and more comments finding valid parent authors as you scroll through the results. A better solution would be to do a search over the span of perhaps a week, pulling out the author name and comment ID for each comment and saving the results in a lookup table. Then that lookup table could be stored as a resource for use with the `lookup` module in a search of shorter duration.

This example also shows another limitation of the eval module in its current state: it only executes one statement or expression, so we have to wrap the logic inside an `if true {}` statement.
